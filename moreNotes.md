Key aims/design constraints:

- base our design on silicon transistors we already have in stock and avoid 'mystical bullshit'
	- we have 2N2222 2N2907 2N3904 2N3906 A1015 BC327 BC337 C1815 S8050 S8550
- mount the PCB in a repurposed metal case that can be found at our local supermarket
- use DPDT footswitches we already have using a ['true bypass' wiring scheme](https://stinkfoot.se/archives/2233) (for now `no LED, no problem`)
- use pots we already have in stock: 
- used a tried an tested design, so as not to get bogged down in circuit theory
- simulate it as a 'sanity check' before ordering


Single knob, but needs 2N5088: https://www.home-wrecker.com/sili-face2.html


Needs 2K lin and 50K log pot: https://fuzzcentral.ssguitar.com/schematics/axisfuzzschem.gif
- 50K we have

2N2222: This is a popular general-purpose NPN transistor and is occasionally used in fuzz face circuits. It can work well in these circuits but might not be as common as some other choices.

2N2907: This is a PNP transistor, less commonly used in fuzz face circuits which typically use NPN transistors. It's more often found in other types of circuits due to its complementary nature to NPN transistors.

2N3904: This is a very commonly used NPN transistor and is frequently used in fuzz face pedal designs. It's known for its affordability and availability, making it a popular choice for DIY projects.

BC337: This is an NPN transistor and is occasionally used in fuzz face circuits, though it might not be as common as some other choices like the 2N3904.
